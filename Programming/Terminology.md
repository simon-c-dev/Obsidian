This file is used as a reference for basic terminology in relation to the world of software engineering.

**Host** => A host is _any computer connected to a network_. It can provide information, applications or services to other hosts or nodes on the network.

**Build Process** => The build process is a series of steps that takes a description of objects to create and the order in which to create them, and then runs the commands to create those objects. In software development, the build process compiles and packages source code into an executable form.

**REST API** => A way for a server/service to communicate with clients. An API defines functions it exposes to clients.

**Resource** => A resource is any object, document, or information that the API can receive from clients or send to clients.

**DTO** => A data transfer object (DTO) is **an object that carries data between processes**. You can use this technique to facilitate communication between two systems (like an API and your server) without potentially exposing sensitive information.
